== Description

python-playground is a tool for invoking the interactive python shell, but
with tab completion turned on and some modules preloaded.

    python-playground               # Start Python and handy modules
    python-playground --none        # Start up with no extras
    python-playground -yaml         # Start up with all except yaml
    python-playground --none yaml   # Start up with nothing except yaml
    python-playground xyz test_foo  # Start up then import xyz and test_foo

You can copy the included sample-config.yaml to ~/.python-playground/config.yaml
and set up your own custom configuration.
