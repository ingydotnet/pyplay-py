This is my Sandbox for learning Python and playing in the Python Shell.

There is a script to start Python with readline tab completion, and
basic modules loaded.

    ./python-sandbox                # Start Python and handy module
    ./python-sandbox --none         # Start up with no extras
    ./python-sandbox --no-yaml      # Start up with all except yaml
    ./python-sandbox --none --yaml  # Start up with nothing except yaml
    ./python-sandbox xyz test_foo   # Start up then import xyz and test_foo

When I have something to prove about the behavior of Python, I code it as a
test in tests/.

    make tests          # Run all the tests
